# Budget Tracker

A simple budget tracker app, using React.js. The user is able to log incomes and expenses, mark expenses as paid or unpaid, and filter the paid/ unpaid expenses. The home page shows the total income, expenses, and balance remaining.

## Prerequisite
npm install  
npm install react bootstrap bootstrap  
npm install react-router-dom  
json-server --watch src/db.json --port 4000  
npm start

## Future Steps
For the moment this is a very basic budget tracker. In the future, I will implement some of the below features:  
Add date option  
Add expense/ income type or category  
Add extra filter options for example date, category  
Implement more user friendly styling  
Add option to see remaining balance after expenses have been marked as paid/ unpaid
